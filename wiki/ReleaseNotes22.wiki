  * Support for [CustomHeaderFields]
  * Excerpts now auto-generate from the content, if we're crossposting excerpts and the post doesn't have an excerpt specified 
  * Added another filter, `ljxp_pre_process_excerpt`, applied to the excerpt before it's crossposted. Developers should use this in addition to `ljxp_pre_process_post` to support both excerpt and full-text options.

  * The LiveJournal URL of the post is now stored in a custom field, so you can easily [http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/wiki/LinkingToLJ add the link to your WP entry]. (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/issues/detail?id=51">#51</a>)
  * Galleries are now crossposted with inline styles, so their grid layout is maintained (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ljxp/issues/detail?id=117">#117</a>)
