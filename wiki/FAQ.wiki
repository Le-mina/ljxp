== Common Error Messages ==

* "Something went wrong - 302 : Client error: Can't edit post from requested journal" *

Explanation: The reason for this message to be shown is that you probably have crossposted an entry before, deleted it manually, and then tried to edit it from WP again.

Solution: Clean up all _ljxp_ fields in post custom fields, then make sure you have set the crossposting on, and save the entry again. This will result into a new entry being posted in your LiveJournal.

* "Something went wrong - 208 : Client error: Invalid text encoding: The text entered is not a valid UTF-8 stream"*

Solution: Tags must only use the standard English alphabet. If you're using diagritics or a foreign alphabet, either don't post the tags or figure out a way to translate them. For example, check out the solution that people have come up with for [http://ebroder.net/livejournal-crossposter/i18n/ LJXP in Russian].
